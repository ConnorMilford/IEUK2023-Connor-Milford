            GM (Genetically modified) crops will play a huge role in this,
            in that scientists can specifically code for traits that will reduce space of plants,
            make them grow larger and with less water as well as reducing their ghg(greenhouse gas) emissions by 10%,
            as well as being on average 22% more productive. GM crops also reduce the need for pesticides, therefore making the plants more beneficial to humans.
            Furthermore, this helps to tackle other problems as, more food can be grown on the same amount of land,
            meaning there is more food for the 800 million people who are chronically hungry.

            Smart irrigation systems are systems that measure the soils moisture and deliver water only when necessary and supply the precise amount of water.
            Smart irrigation systems are often paired with soil quality monitoring technology to collect data
            on the soil and deliver exactly what needs to be delivered in order to make the soil as efficient as possible.

            Nitrogen fixing bacteria can be used to greatly reduce fertilizer use on farms,
            as fertilizer is used to introduce nitrogen into the soil which can be done by these bacteria
            instead of relying on fertilizer which is responsible for >20% of total agricultural emissions.

            Vertical farming can greatly reduce the land needed for a farm.
            It can also reduce water usage in that a farm can reduce its water consumption
            by 95% through recycling the water and harvesting rainwater. The technology is still new but is incredibly promising.

            Enhancing natural habitats is one of the simplest ways to move closer to net zero emissions,
            this is done through using natural fencing for crops and wildlife such as hedges and trees which
            acts as a habitat for wildlife.

            Biomass boiler heaters/solar power are an interesting way to reduce the carbon footprint,
            and also allow farmers to diversify their own income and sell power back to the grid, as well as
            reducing the farms own energy costs. AD (anaerobic digestion) Plants can also be used to manage waste as well as produce energy
            and allow farmers to turn their waste into more money through the use of bacteria.
