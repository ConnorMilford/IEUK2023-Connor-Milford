  <p>
    These solutions come with one main problem, their cost. This is one of the main problems with farming in that, it is not that profitable.
    However, introducing these technologies is a win-win for farms in that not only does it make them more sustainable,
    but it also increases their profits as their crops require less input.
  </p>

  <p>
    These technologies are only as green as the electricity they consume which is why it is important for farmers
    to invest in electricity production of their, as not only does it produce zero emission energy,
    but allows the farmers to diversify their own income through selling electricity back to the grid.
    Starting with a less expensive technology such as this allows the SME to slowly build towards net carbon zero.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is also possible for these SMEs to look into loans such as the enhanced capital allowance scheme offered by Lloyds bank
    which is a low interest loan made specifically to help smes reach net carbon zero and offers rewards for reducing the environmental impact of the business.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another problem is that most SMEs struggle to actually measure their own carbon output.
    How can a business reach net-zero if they do not know their own output?
    These can be measured by calculating:
      <ol>
          <li>Scope 1, Direct emissions from sources controlled by your company, such as vehicles, and equipment.</li>
          <li>Scope 2, Indirect emissions from energy bought by your company, such as heat, cooling and electricity.</li>
          <li>Scope 3, Other indirect emissions, these are things such as waste, travel, staff commuting, and material use.</li>
      </ol>
  </p>


  <p>
    Scope 1 Emissions can reach zero by using farm equipment that does not use fossil fuels, and use technology such as drones,
    and other farm robots in order to reduce the carbon output.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scope 2 emissions can be solved by becoming more self sustainable through the use of electricity generating
    technologies mentioned prior. For example, an SMEs electricity output can be replaced with entirely solar,
    or using the AD plant, or biomass boilers. AD plants and biomass boilers have the added benefit of reducing
    the waste produced by the farm and turning it directly into energy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scope 3 emissions are reduced through AD plants and Biomass boilers in that the volume of waste produced is decreased,
    Travel emissions can be solved through using public transport, and travel to work schemes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally the problem of ordering from supply chains which are highly polluting can be solved through researching
    which supply chains are the least polluting, and ensuring the business chooses these. If the most polluting
    supply chains lose customers because of their polluting, they are more likely to reduce their carbon output.
